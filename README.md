# DS1307-LIBRARY
This project provides an Arduino-style C++ library for interfacing the DS1307 RTC (Real-Time Clock) module with the Raspberry Pi Pico using the Pico SDK. The DS1307 uses the I2C protocol to keep track of time (hours, minutes, seconds) and calendar (day, month, year) even when the main power is disconnected, using a backup coin-cell battery.
